# myself
Web application that provides a single space for personal-development through *custom physical and mental health activities* centered around the **individual**â€”meditation, stretching, saving text quotes, etc.
#
### A way to organize myself.
I often find myself doing many small wellness "activities" throughout each day.
But, it's difficult to stay consistent when you end up doing a little bit of everything. I felt I needed some way to effortlessly do all of these activities from one place where I could, essentially, organize myself.
#
My long-term vision for this app includes the ability for users to create custom activity modules with their own custom features, daily reminders/other useful notificaitons, integration with external apps (i.e. health information, note transferring).
